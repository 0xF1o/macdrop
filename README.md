# Macdrop
Experimental tooling to support lakedrop on macos.  
Depends on [apple/container](https://github.com/apple/container/releases).  
May work on other platforms too that have python3 and podman/docker.

## Install/Update
```sh
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/macdrop https://0xf1o.github.io/macdrop/macdrop.py && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/macdrop
```
