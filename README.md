# Macdrop
Experimental tooling to support lakedrop on mac  
Depends on [apple/container](https://github.com/apple/container/releases)  
May work on other platforms too that have python3 and podman/docker

## Install/Update
```sh
sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/macdrop https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0xF1o/macdrop/refs/heads/main/macdrop.py && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/macdrop
